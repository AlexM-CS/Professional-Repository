Today is the day I started working on Tuba Knight. First of all, I'd
love to give a thank you to Brayden (aka GDcheerios) for inspiring me to
make this, as I was really compelled by his "Gentry's Quest" project to
make something of the same caliber. Really impressive stuff, and it's alot
of fun.

This project takes inspiration from a couple of different things in
regards to its gameplay.
First, obviously, the "Tuba Knight" is a reference to the meme rabbit hole
you can find all over YouTube. Generally, this meme involves people making
boss/character themes for a game called Tuba Knight that doesn't actually exist.
It's a pretty good bit in my opinion, although I'm far from the first person to
have the idea of actually making it into a game, and even though this project isn't
as impressive as some attempts I've seen for this idea, I just want to make something
I'm personally proud of. Additionally, if I end up somehow attaching music to this
project in the future, it will likely be inspired by these memes.

Second, I'd like to make it similar in gameplay to "West of Loathing" by Asymmetric
Publications. The game is extremely funny, creative, and fun. Overall, I'd say it's a
masterclass on how to make a player care about the world of a game. From the ability
to personalize your character, horse, pardner, gear, and even the decisions you make,
every playthrough feels special, different, and even playing the game dozens of times
isn't enough to discover all it has to offer. Because I plan on making this an ongoing
project, I'm going to implement all the underlying systems first, and then slowly expand
the world more and more, until I feel like it is complete.

Finally, the gameplay is meant to feel like a JRPG (Japanese Role-Playing Game), which
from my experience means an RPG involving stats and equipment, turn-based combat, leveling,
party members, and much more. Even though this is the first thing I'm writing for this
project, I'll probably end up making a "research" file or something along those lines
where I document all my exact sources of inspiration after doing a bit of research, and I'll
go more in depth there on what elements of gameplay I'll be using.

While I tried to jump straight into development yesterday, I quickly discovered I needed to
do a bit more research and make a clear strategy on how I wanted to create this project.

To accomplish this, I mostly took the day off of writing code and put my time towards planning
this project out, at least in my head. Not really a "plan," so much as the order to build this
project in. Helping me out in this ordering was Brayden, the one who inspired me to make
this in the first place. I took some time to study Gentry's Quest, as it is completely open source.
The link to Brayden's GitHub, and thus the source code for Gentry's Quest, is in the sources file.
