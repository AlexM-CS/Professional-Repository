The call to construct a new lizard (Lizard()) requires no arguments to be given in the constructor,
as seen in the SimpleTests class.

Cell(int col, int row) creates a new cell with the given coordinates.
It is important to remember that the indices for each cell begin at 1, not at 0.
(As seen in the Cell class)

BodySegment(Lizard lizard, Cell cell) turns the given cell into a new lizard segment.

ArrayList<BodySegment> is an array that contains cells, each of which contains the coordinates
for a given body segment of a lizard, as well as the lizard that it belongs to.
